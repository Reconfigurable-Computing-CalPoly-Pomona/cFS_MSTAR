# This work has been done as a collaboration between California State Polytechnic University, Pomona and JPL/NASA on studying CFS Flight-software under NASA M-STAR Grant# 80NSSC20K1859 

# CFS Distribution used to benchmark the flight software overhead on a PYNQ Z2 SoC

## PYNQ Introduction
PYNQ or Python Productivity for Zynq, is a project created by Xilinx and is a member of the Zynq class of devices. The Zynq architecture combines a dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 with a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). PYNQ enables users to use the Python language and libraries to build electronic systems. Two boards which implement PYNQ are the PYNQ-Z1 and the PYNQ-Z2.

## cFS Introduction
The Core Flight System (cFS) is a generic flight software architecture framework used on flagship spacecraft, human spacecraft, cubesats, and Raspberry Pi. cFS is made up of the cFE(Core Flight Executive), OSAL(Operating System Abstraction Layer), PSP(Platform Support Package), and a selection of flight apps that correspond to specific mission requirements. The cFS bundel is still updating currently, and NASA/cFS includes all the necessary tools and applications under the link below.
